Î¥ou need a table with the locations of the FIT files to be analysed. This table must be prepared in advance. In the utilities there are two small and fast utilities:
checkFields.js is to check fields in the FIT tested file, and createSummaryTable.js is to create the table. If the table is builded correctly, 
by clicking the  "Plot" button in the main form you can send the FIT file content to the fitplotter form. How to use these utlities is written brielfy inside them. (To be continued)
